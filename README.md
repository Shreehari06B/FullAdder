# Full Adder - Logic Circuit Project

A **Full Adder** is a basic combinational circuit in electronics. It adds three binary inputs and produces:

- **Sum** (A ⊕ B ⊕ Cin)

- **Carry** (A·B + Cin·(A⊕B))


This project was created using **Logic Circuit Simulator Pro** on Android.

How it Works

The Full Adder adds three 1-bit inputs: A, B, and Cin.

The Sum is calculated using XOR gates.

The Carry is calculated using a combination of AND and OR gates.


The circuit is built using drag-and-drop logic gates in the app.
